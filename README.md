## 🔍 Overview
How does public **EV charging infrastructure** relate to **gasoline use** over time—and who benefits?  
This project builds a **county–year panel (2014–2023)** for California and estimates the relationship between **charger availability** and **gasoline consumption**, with attention to **equity** (access across different communities).

**Core questions**
- Do more public chargers associate with **lower gasoline use** (per capita / per registered vehicle)?
- Are effects **heterogeneous** (urban vs. rural; income levels; EV adoption levels)?
- How is **charger access** distributed (equity lens)?

**Methods (high level)**
- **Two-way fixed effects (TWFE)** panel models with **county FE** + **year FE**  
- Robust/clustered SEs; alternative specs as sensitivity checks  
- Descriptive mapping and trend plots

## 🛠 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Construct county–year panel (2014–2023): public charger counts (L1/L2/DC Fast), EV registrations, income, population, gasoline sales.
- Build derived metrics: charger density (per capita / per EV), **capacity proxy**, and **coverage** (% of land within a buffer of any public charger).

2. **Model Formulation (TWFE OLS)**

Our study employs a two-way fixed-effects OLS regression model:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{gas\_per\_capita}_{it} &= \beta_1\,\text{level1}_{it} + \beta_2\,\text{level2}_{it} + \beta_3\,\text{dc\_fast}_{it} + \beta_4\,\text{ev\_adoption}_{it} \\
&\quad + \beta_5\,\text{income}_{it} + \beta_6\,\text{charger\_ratio}_{it} + \beta_7\,\text{capacity\_ratio}_{it} + \beta_8\,\text{coverage}_{it} \\
&\quad + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
```

where $\alpha_i$ and $\gamma_t$ are county and year fixed effects respectively. Standard errors are clustered by county to account for serial correlation.

3. **Outputs**
- Clean tables of FE model coefficients (with units, p-value and interpretation)
- Maps/plots of charger access and gasoline trends
- Equity charts (e.g., charger access by income quintile)

## 🔁 Reproducibility
- **Quick view:** open `Outputs/Summer_Research_Code_Final.html` in your browser.
- **Run locally (R):**
  1) Open the project at repo root  
  2) Restore packages and render:
     ```r
     install.packages("renv")      # if needed
     renv::restore()               # installs exact versions from renv.lock
     rmarkdown::render("Notebooks/Summer_Research_Code_Final.Rmd",
                       output_file = "../Outputs/Summer_Research_Code_Final.html")
     ```
- Environment managed with **renv** (commit `renv.lock`, `renv/activate.R`, `.Rprofile`; ignore `renv/library/`).

## 📈 Key Findings
- Greater **public charger availability/coverage** is associated with **lower gasoline use per capita**, controlling for county/year effects.  
- Relationships tend to be **stronger in high-EV or urban counties**; equity views highlight variation in access across communities.  
- Results are **robust** across alternative normalizations and coverage definitions; diagnostics support model assumptions.
