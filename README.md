## 🔍 Overview
How does public **EV charging infrastructure** relate to **gasoline use** over time—and who benefits?  
This project builds a **county–year panel (2014–2023)** for California and estimates the relationship between **charger availability** and **gasoline consumption**, with attention to **equity** (access across different communities).

**Core questions**
- Do more public chargers associate with **lower gasoline use** (per capita / per registered vehicle)?
- Are effects **heterogeneous** (urban vs. rural; income levels; EV adoption levels)?
- How is **charger access** distributed (equity lens)?

**Methods (high level)**
- **Two-way fixed effects (TWFE)** panel models with **county FE** + **year FE**  
- Robust/clustered SEs; alternative specs as sensitivity checks  
- Descriptive mapping and trend plots
